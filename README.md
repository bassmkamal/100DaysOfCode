|Design Patterns|[Learn Design-patterns in kotlin](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-patterns-in-android-with-kotlin/)<br>[practice Design-patterns](https://github.com/dbacinski/Design-Patterns-In-Kotlin)<br>it would be great if you practice all of the patters, you can start with these <br> Factory, Adapter, Builder, Composite, Decorator, Listener, Observer, Singleton, Strategy|
|Data Structures / Algorithms   |[Data structure Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsB6SWUrDFW2RmDotAfPbeHu)<br>It would be awesome if you finish the whole playlist with practice, <br>but you can just learn the first 18 videos then from 24 to 37 as a start.|
|Clean Code|[Clean code freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/clean-coding-for-beginners/)<br>it would be great if you can purchase Clean code book by Uncle bob|

|Database Design| [Database Design by Dr. Elmasry](https://docs.ccsu.edu/curriculumsheets/ChadTest.pdf)<br> Read ch1, ch2, ch3, ch4, ch7, ch8, ch9, and of course the more you read the more you will understand complex topics, but as a start you need to understand these chapters mentioned.|

## How we will accomplish that ?

### we will pick a topic (Room) for example and the responsible mentor about that topic will:
- guide you with tutorials and  estimated time for it (tow days) for example.
- then will be a live session to discuss the topic from a senior prospective with best practice and security.
- demonstrate live example from a real project.
- discuss some interview questions about that topic.
- Task with code review.
